# ItemDecoration
Item Decoration for RecyclerView

## [GridSpacingDecoration](itemdecoration/src/main/java/com/gelitenight/itemdecoration/GridSpacingDecoration.java)
* ItemDecoration which works well with different span size in a single RecyclerView.

* Spacings will only be add between rows(horizontally) and columns(vertically). If you need spacing above 1st row / below last row / to left of first column / to right of last column, please use padding of RecyclerView.
